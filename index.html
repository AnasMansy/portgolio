                    <p>Over the past two years, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                        ReactJS through a combination
                        of self-learning, online courses, and numerous web development projects.
                        These projects have allowed me to gain experience with various libraries and frameworks,
                    
                        and to collaborate with team members to ensure consistent design and functionality across
                        multiple projects.

                        In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving and communication skills,
                        which have been honed through
                        my academic and professional experiences. I am comfortable working in a fast-paced environment
                        and am able to adapt quickly
                        to new technologies and requirements..</p>

                            <p class="intern-description">During my 3-month internship at Algoriza, I gained hands-on
                                experience in web development
                                using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                                and ReactJS. I worked on a variety of projects, including a responsive website, a web
                                app with dynamic content, and a ReactJS application
                                with Redux state management.
                                I collaborated with a team of developers and designers, and received mentorship and code
                                review from senior developers.
                                <br>
                                Through this experience, I developed my technical skills in web development and gained a
                                deeper understanding of
                                software development best practices. I also improved my communication and teamwork
                                skills, as well as my ability
                                to work effectively in a fast-paced environment. Overall, my internship at Algoriza was
                                a valuable learning experience
                                that has prepared me for a career in web development.

                                As a volunteer with the IEEE Student Branch, I participated in a variety of activities
                                and projects that helped me develop my teamwork skills. I attended
                                technical
                                sessions on topics such as web developing and soft skills

                                One of my most rewarding experiences with the IEEE team was teaching basic C++
                                programming to
                                a group of high school students. I created lesson plans and materials, and worked
                                one-on-one
                                with students to help them understand programming concepts and complete coding
                                challenges.
                                Through this experience, I developed my teaching
                                and mentoring skills and gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of STEM
                                education.

                                Overall, my volunteer experience with the IEEE team was a valuable learning experience
                                that helped me develop
                                a range of skills and gave me the opportunity to contribute to my community.
                                I am proud to have been a part of such a dynamic and inspiring organization.
